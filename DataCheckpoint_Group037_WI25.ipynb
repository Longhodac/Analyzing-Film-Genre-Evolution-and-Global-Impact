    "Films and movies are powerful tools for reflecting aspects of society and human relationships, conveying various messages to a large audience. The evolution of predominant genres and themes serves a fascinating lens to examine the intersection of cinema and societal change. Themes and genres of films have evolved over time, mostly driven by factors such as audience demand or a desire of innovative concepts.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Over the past two decades, global events have shaped the continuously growing film industry. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning late 2019, has had far-reaching effects. The historic event marked a change in industry trends, production, and audience engagement.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) More importantly, the pandemic has affected every socioeconomic and political aspect of society. These changes have also potentially altered the landscape of popular cinema, affecting the types of narratives that find commercial success and popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been many discussions surrounding the cultural and social influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on film genres, reflecting the changing values, fears, and politics of society over time. Most authors focus on the impact of the pandemic on film marketing and production, but they have not explored much on potential shifts in genres. To look a little more closely on this topic overall, we can explore the shifts in trending genres that have been noted after certain major events. For instance, dystopian movies (or movies that focused on the idea of mass extinction/plague) gained traction after the development of the atomic bomb during World War 2 and was popularized by Elia Kazan's \"Panic in the Streets\" (1950).<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Another example is the development of the horror genre's diversification of storytelling and incorporating modern themes, such as social and racial injustices as seen in Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" (2017).<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) These examples strengthen the exploration of the reflection of societal events in films. In regards to the pandemic specifically, the topic is still being explored but there are conversations on the event's influence on new horror trends that emphasize isolation and contagion, as seen in films like \"Host\" (2020) which was shot entirely through a Zoom call.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) It seems to mirror the global shift occurring during that time. One thing that could be explored more in depth is how they both impact the other (how films shape cultural/political/economic landscape?). These examples have us interested in the kind of influence the pandemic might have had on popularized genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these discussions provide valuable insights into industry-wide changes, there is a gap in understanding if the pandemic has actually impacted the themes and genres of top-grossing films. In our research, we aim to bridge that gap by comparing the 100 highest-grossing films released post-pandemic (2022-2024) to those from the pre-pandemic period (2000-2019), offering a more nuanced view of how this global event has influenced storytelling in mainstream cinema. We plan on analyzing box office trends and keywords describing genres to find out if certain genres are popularized from the impact of the pandemic, and seeing if there is a correlation of those popularized genres to the socioeconomic and political implications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

    "Our proposed question involves data that includes topics related to movies as well as major world events and historical moments. The ethical implications in our question lead us to ensure that we emphasize correlation over causation and not cherry-picking “world events”.\n",

    "Genre Classification Issues: The way genres and themes are labeled varies across sources. Alsom, automated classification can introduce inaccuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming vs. Theatrical Shifts: Recently, there has been a big shift in audience viewing platforms, particularly the movement from going to movie theaters to streaming platforms like Netflix, Max, Hulu, etc. This could introduce only partial representation of films and give us a less well-rounded answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Western Film Biases: There could be an unequal representation of regional film industries, such that some of the biggest non-Western film industries (Bollywood, Nollywood, Chinese cinema) have huge domestic audiences but are less likely to rank in the global top 50 because they rely on local box office success rather than international distribution. In this way, they could still be reflecting major global events through the lens of their cultural representation but not make it to the top grossing films and their influence would be lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. World Events Data Biases**  \n",
    "Media Coverage: The datasets we use for world events (Our World in Data, IMF, Global Terrorism Database) rely on media reports and institutional records. Media coverage can introduce biases, as some events receive disproportionate attention while others remain underreported.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Political or Cultural Framing: Some sources may reflect the perspectives of the organizations that collect them, particularly those tracking political or terrorism-related events which we may pull data from.  \n",

    "**3. Privacy and Terms of Use Issues**  \n",
    "Our data comes from publicly available sources, but datasets such as IMDb’s data and Kaggle datasets have terms of use that restrict commercial application and redistribution. We will be sure to comply  with these terms. No personally identifiable information is used in our project, so there aren’t many  privacy risks. However, some datasets (like IMDb) contain user-generated content such as reviews, which could come with their own biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Detecting and Mitigating Biases**  \n",
    "To minimize biases in our analysis, we plan to cover a few important bases. Before conducting the main analysis, we will review whether our datasets properly and fully cover diverse film industries and world events. This will help analyze representation in data. We will also try to compare multiple sources to help us check for inconsistencies in classification of events and film genres, as these can be subjective and vary. If we find certain groups, genres, or regions underrepresented, we will explicitly state these limitations in our findings. Finally, we will use transparency in our interpretations. Our results will be sure to not emphasize causation between world events and film trends but will highlight patterns instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Addressing Data Privacy and Equitable Impact**  \n",
    "While our project does not involve personal data, we recognize a few things. A disproportionate focus on certain themes could reinforce stereotypes. In the case that we find an increase in war or terrorism-related movies following real-world conflicts, we must be careful not to draw direct causal conclusions that could create harmful narratives. We also must acknowledge an economic bias in revenue-based metrics. Using revenue as a metric for movie success may disproportionately highlight blockbuster films while overlooking artistic and cultural contributions from non-mainstream cinema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Ethical Handling of Findings**   \n",
    "We will practice responsible communication by ensuring that our conclusions do not oversimplify complex socio-political influences on media trends. We will consider alternative narratives when discussing changes in film themes (ex: acknowledging the role of independent and international cinema even if underrepresented in our dataset)."
