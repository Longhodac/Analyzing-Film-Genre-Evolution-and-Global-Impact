    "Films and movies are powerful tools for reflecting aspects of society and human relationships, conveying various messages to a large audience. The evolution of predominant genres and themes serves a fascinating lens to examine the intersection of cinema and societal change. Themes and genres of films have evolved over time, mostly driven by factors such as audience demand or a desire of innovative concepts.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Over the past two decades, global events have shaped the continuously growing film industry. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning late 2019, has had far-reaching effects. The historic event marked a change in industry trends, production, and audience engagement.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) More importantly, the pandemic has affected every socioeconomic and political aspect of society. These changes have also potentially altered the landscape of popular cinema, affecting the types of narratives that find commercial success and popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been many discussions surrounding the cultural and social influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on film genres, reflecting the changing values, fears, and politics of society over time. Most authors focus on the impact of the pandemic on film marketing and production, but they have not explored much on potential shifts in genres. To look a little more closely on this topic overall, we can explore the shifts in trending genres that have been noted after certain major events. For instance, dystopian movies (or movies that focused on the idea of mass extinction/plague) gained traction after the development of the atomic bomb during World War 2 and was popularized by Elia Kazan's \"Panic in the Streets\" (1950).<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Another example is the development of the horror genre's diversification of storytelling and incorporating modern themes, such as social and racial injustices as seen in Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" (2017).<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) These examples strengthen the exploration of the reflection of societal events in films. In regards to the pandemic specifically, the topic is still being explored but there are conversations on the event's influence on new horror trends that emphasize isolation and contagion, as seen in films like \"Host\" (2020) which was shot entirely through a Zoom call.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) It seems to mirror the global shift occurring during that time. One thing that could be explored more in depth is how they both impact the other (how films shape cultural/political/economic landscape?). These examples have us interested in the kind of influence the pandemic might have had on popularized genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these discussions provide valuable insights into industry-wide changes, there is a gap in understanding if the pandemic has actually impacted the themes and genres of top-grossing films. In our research, we aim to bridge that gap by comparing the 100 highest-grossing films released post-pandemic (2022-2024) to those from the pre-pandemic period (2000-2019), offering a more nuanced view of how this global event has influenced storytelling in mainstream cinema. We plan on analyzing box office trends and keywords describing genres to find out if certain genres are popularized from the impact of the pandemic, and seeing if there is a correlation of those popularized genres to the socioeconomic and political implications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

    " ### 1. Coefficient for Period: -1.4853\n",
    "- Suggests that, on average, genres appear slightly less frequently in the top 100 highest-grossing films post- pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. \n",
    "- The effect size is small (about -1.49 occurrences on average).\n",
    "- **No strong evidence** that the pandemic caused a major shift in genre frequency among top-grossing films.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. P-value for Period: 0.776\n",
    "- Since p = 0.776 is much higher than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- Change in genre frequency could be due to *random variation* rather than a real trend.\n",
    "- **No statistically significant evidence** that the pandemic changed genre popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. R-squared: 0.003\n",
    "- Means that only 0.3% of the variation in genre frequency is explained by the pandemic period (pre vs. post).\n",
    "- Extremely low value, meaning that *other factors beyond the pandemic must affecting changes in genre trends*.\n",
    "- So, the pandemic itself **does not appear** to be a strong predictor of changes in genre frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Confidence Interval: [-12.021, 9.050]\n",
    "- Since it includes both negative and positive values (-12.021 to 9.050), the effect could be strongly negative, positive, or nonexistent.\n",
    "- This wide range means we *lack precise evidence* about how the pandemic impacted genre frequency.\n",
    "- Because the interval crosses zero, **we cannot conclude that the pandemic definitely impacted genres** in a meaningful way.\n",

However, in the post-pandemic movies, we see words like \"murder,\" \"death,\" \"alien,\" and \"crime\" to appear, which were not seen before in the pre-pandemic movies keywords. This is interesting because it possibly describes a shift toward darker themes in films post-pandemic. However, the keywords that are most frequently used to describe pre-pandemic movies have no relevance to the storytelling elements itself. Words like \"superhero,\" \"family,\" and \"relationship\" remain a little consistent (with \"relationship\" increasing post-pandemic), which leaves our results a little inconclusive."

    "### What Can We Conclude?\n",
    "Our analysis reveals an intriguing shift in the thematic focus and sentiment of movies pre- and post-oandemic, suggesting potential changes in storytelling approaches toward darker, more serious narratives. This could reflect an industry response to global uncertainty during the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key observation is that pre-pandemic movies appeared to emphasize adventure and heroicism, whereas post-pandemic films exhibit a broader emotional spectrum, incorporating both positive and negative sentiments. The sentiment analysis shows that although neutral words dominate both datasets, post-pandemic movies display greater variation, with more words classified as strongly positive or strongly negative. This suggests that filmmakers may be exploring a wider range of human experiences. However, it is also possible that this variation stems from changes in how movies are marketed and described rather than a fundamental shift in storytelling itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these patterns, there are some inconsistencies and potential limitations in our findings. For example, certain recurring words like \"superhero,\" \"family,\" and \"relationship\" remain frequent across both time periods. This continuity raises questions about whether the observed shift is truly indicative of industry-wide changes or if it is more reflective of shifts in specific genres. Additionally, the sentiment analysis, while informative, does not provide full context for how these words are used in the narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible limitation is the way in which movie overviews and keywords are generated. If the keywords are pulled from marketing descriptions rather than actual film content, the results may reflect changes in how studios promote films rather than genuine shifts in storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while our findings suggest a move toward more emotionally varied and thematically darker narratives in post-pandemic films, additional research is needed to confirm whether these changes are truly reflective of broader storytelling trends or if they are influenced by external factors such as marketing strategies, genre distributions, or shifts in audience engagement."

    "Simpson's Diversity Index (SDI) is a measure used to quantify the diversity of a dataset. In this case, it helps us understand the diversity of movie genres. The SDI value ranges between 0 and 1:\n",
    "- A **higher value** (close to 1) indicates **lower diversity**, meaning most of the movies belong to a small number of genres.\n",
    "- A **lower value** (close to 0) indicates **higher diversity**, meaning the genres are more evenly distributed across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre Pandemic Movies: 0.896\n",
    "- An SDI of **0.896** suggests that the genre distribution for **pre-pandemic movies** is somewhat concentrated around a few dominant genres.\n",
    "- This could be seen with a higher concentration of both **Adventure** and **Action** movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post Pandemic Movies: 0.909\n",
    "- The SDI for **post-pandemic movies** is **0.909**, which is slightly higher than the pre-pandemic value.\n",
    "- This indicates that the **post-pandemic movie genre distribution** is **slightly more concentrated**, with fewer diverse genres than the pre-pandemic period.\n",
    "- In the graph, we can see that **Action** movies are the **only** dominant genre in post-pandemic movies, while pre-andemic movies have **two** dominant genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- While both periods show a **relatively high SDI**, indicating a concentration of movie genres, the **post-pandemic period** shows a **slightly more concentrated genre distribution** than the pre-pandemic period.\n",
    "- There was a slight shift in genre diversity through the COVID-19 pandemic with **Action** remaining a dominant genre while **Adventure** taking a small decline.\n",
    "- Even though the post-pandemic movie set had an **extra** genre, it wasn't enough to lower its SDI value."

    "The ethical considerations in our project include a variety of stages in the data science timeline, from beginning to end. Our goal is to ensure that our study remains unbiased, respects privacy concerns, and provides meaningful insights without any misrepresentation.\n",
    "While our datasets cover a broad range of topics, they also present some potential biases and ethical concerns that we would like to acknowledge and address:\n",
    "Our proposed question involves data that includes topics related to movies as well as major world events and historical moments. The ethical implications in our question lead us to ensure that we emphasize correlation over causation and not cherry-picking “world events”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Film Data Biases** \n",
    "Genre Classification Issues: The way genres and themes are labeled varies across sources. Alsom, automated classification can introduce inaccuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming vs. Theatrical Shifts: Recently, there has been a big shift in audience viewing platforms, particularly the movement from going to movie theaters to streaming platforms like Netflix, Max, Hulu, etc. This could introduce only partial representation of films and give us a less well-rounded answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Western Film Biases: There could be an unequal representation of regional film industries, such that some of the biggest non-Western film industries (Bollywood, Nollywood, Chinese cinema) have huge domestic audiences but are less likely to rank in the global top 50 because they rely on local box office success rather than international distribution. In this way, they could still be reflecting major global events through the lens of their cultural representation but not make it to the top grossing films and their influence would be lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. World Events Data Biases**  \n",
    "Media Coverage: The datasets we use for world events (Our World in Data, IMF, Global Terrorism Database) rely on media reports and institutional records. Media coverage can introduce biases, as some events receive disproportionate attention while others remain underreported.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Political or Cultural Framing: Some sources may reflect the perspectives of the organizations that collect them, particularly those tracking political or terrorism-related events which we may pull data from.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Privacy and Terms of Use Issues**  \n",
    "Our data comes from publicly available sources, but datasets such as IMDb’s data and Kaggle datasets have terms of use that restrict commercial application and redistribution. We will be sure to comply  with these terms. No personally identifiable information is used in our project, so there aren’t many  privacy risks. However, some datasets (like IMDb) contain user-generated content such as reviews, which could come with their own biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Detecting and Mitigating Biases**  \n",
    "To minimize biases in our analysis, we plan to cover a few important bases. Before conducting the main analysis, we will review whether our datasets properly and fully cover diverse film industries and world events. This will help analyze representation in data. We will also try to compare multiple sources to help us check for inconsistencies in classification of events and film genres, as these can be subjective and vary. If we find certain groups, genres, or regions underrepresented, we will explicitly state these limitations in our findings. Finally, we will use transparency in our interpretations. Our results will be sure to not emphasize causation between world events and film trends but will highlight patterns instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Addressing Data Privacy and Equitable Impact**  \n",
    "While our project does not involve personal data, we recognize a few things. A disproportionate focus on certain themes could reinforce stereotypes. In the case that we find an increase in war or terrorism-related movies following real-world conflicts, we must be careful not to draw direct causal conclusions that could create harmful narratives. We also must acknowledge an economic bias in revenue-based metrics. Using revenue as a metric for movie success may disproportionately highlight blockbuster films while overlooking artistic and cultural contributions from non-mainstream cinema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Ethical Handling of Findings**   \n",
    "We will practice responsible communication by ensuring that our conclusions do not oversimplify complex socio-political influences on media trends. We will consider alternative narratives when discussing changes in film themes (ex: acknowledging the role of independent and international cinema even if underrepresented in our dataset)."
